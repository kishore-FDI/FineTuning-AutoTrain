# Fine-Tuning the Mistral 7B Sharded Model with AutoTrain and QLoRA

Welcome to our project! We're working on fine-tuning the Mistral 7B sharded model with a custom dataset and the orca dataset using AutoTrain and QLoRA. This project aims to create a powerful AI model capable of generating high-quality responses in a conversational setting.

## Features

- **Fine-Tuning**: We're using the Mistral 7B sharded model as our base, and fine-tuning it to improve its performance on our specific task.
- **AutoTrain**: This feature allows us to automate the training process, making it easier to fine-tune our model.
- **QLoRA**: QLoRA, or Query Likelihood with Out-of-domain Relevance Augmentation, is a technique we're using to improve the relevance of our model's responses.

## Technology Stack

Our project uses a variety of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Python**: The main language used for developing our project.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library for Python, used for applications such as natural language processing.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A library that provides general-purpose architectures for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG).


## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Gather the data you'll be using to fine-tune the model. This could be a collection of dialogues, a list of question-answer pairs, or any other type of conversational data.
2. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Use the AutoTrain feature to fine-tune the Mistral 7B model on your dataset. This will adjust the model's parameters to better fit your data.
3. **Generate Responses**: Once the model has been fine-tuned, you can use it to generate responses. Just input a message, and the model will generate a relevant response!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you're interested in contributing, here are a few ways you can help:

- **Data Collection**: Help us gather more data to fine-tune our model.
- **Model Training**: Assist in the fine-tuning process by training the model on new data.
- **Testing and Feedback**: Use our model and provide feedback on its performance.
